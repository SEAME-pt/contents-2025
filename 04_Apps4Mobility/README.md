What is an automotive hackathon?
A time-boxed, hands-on event where small teams rapidly design, prototype, and demo in-vehicle or mobility applications and services.
Typical outcomes include a functioning demo, brief presentation, and supporting documentation.

The hackathons are organized in partnership with external companies, so detailed information will be shared closer to the date.
