# Goals for this Module

## Goal 1: Getting Familiarized with PiRacer Robot and Hardware

Your journey begins by assembling your very own **PiRacer** robot. This small-scale autonomous vehicle is powered by **Raspberry Pi 5**, a versatile mini-computer, and equipped with sensors, motors, and a display. You'll explore fundamental hardware components including:

- Raspberry Pi 5 setup 
- HAILO AI Hat assembly on the Rasperry 5
- Servo motors for steering  
- DC motors for propulsion  
- Display interface

Additionally, you'll develop a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application using the **Qt** framework. This will run directly on the PiRacer display, giving you hands-on experience with embedded UI design.

## Goal 2: Implementing Scrum and Agile Methodologies

Agile methodologies like **Scrum** provide flexible, iterative approaches to software development. You'll:

- Organize into small collaborative teams  
- Set up sprint cycles, stand-up meetings, and retrospectives
- Creating and maitaining a Scrum board that reflects sprint goals and progress accurately.
- Learn how Agile fosters better communication, continuous feedback, and incremental improvements  

This practical experience will help you appreciate the power of Agile in real-world automotive software projects.

## Goal 3: Learning Git and GitHub

Version control systems like **Git**, and collaboration platforms like **GitHub**, are vital tools in modern software engineering. During this module, you will:

- Understand basic Git concepts such as commits, branches, merges, and resolving conflicts  
- Collaborate effectively using GitHub repositories, issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews  
- Establish best practices to manage code efficiently and safely within a team environment  
- Leverage GitHub Actions to enable continuous development and integration.

Mastering Git and GitHub will enable your team to collaborate seamlessly and maintain high-quality code.

## Goal 4: Getting Familiarized with Trustable Software Framework (TSF)

The **Trustable Software Framework (TSF)** is critical in automotive software development due to stringent safety and reliability requirements. TSF helps you:

- Clearly define and refine software requirements  
- Maintain traceability between requirements, architecture, implementation, and testing  
- Ensure robust software design, thorough testing, and proper documentation  

Hands-on exercises using TSF tools will illustrate how trustable software development processes prevent errors and ensure compliance with automotive industry standards.

## Goal 5: GenAI Pair Programming

Generative AI tools, such as advanced code assistants, can significantly boost developer productivity. During this module, you'll explore:

- Techniques for effective pair programming with generative AI  
- Best practices for reviewing AI-generated code  
- Integration strategies to seamlessly incorporate AI assistance into your workflow  

Embracing AI-driven tools early in your learning journey will enhance your coding skills, help solve complex problems faster, and prepare you for future industry practices.
