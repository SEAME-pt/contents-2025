### What is value?

For organizations, value is…

The **benefit to the customer** => represented in terms of happiness, that results from the use of a product or service.
The **benefit to the organization** => represented in money terms, that results from the use of a product or service.
The **benefit to society** => not necessarily represented in money terms, that results from the use of a product or service.

**Favor Value Creation over Revenue Extraction**

### What is the only way for a Scrum Team to deliver value?

A Release Is Needed to Realize Value!

Examples of Releases:

- Analyzing the industry and competition
- Identifying customers and their needs
- Forecasting and feasibility
- Strategic product planning
- Release planning Release execution
- Product Launch
- Auditing results
- Sustaining the product
- Product retirement
- Creating a roadmap
- Identifying requirements
- Creating the business case

### Value-Driven Development Recommendations

**TRY**
- Finding patterns and relationships in metrics that help understand how to improve value delivery
- Managing value direction by using leading and lagging indicators
- Starting customer and stakeholder discussions with outcomes

**FAVOR**
- Linking goals to value
- Using additional tools such as impact mapping to link outcome to possible output
- Using the definition of value in Backlog Refinement, Sprint Planning, and Sprint Review
- Differentiating Customer segments, and what they consider as valuable 
- Using trends in metrics, not absolutes

**AVOID**
- Defining features as value
- Accepting business value as an organizationally dictated number without analysis and understanding
- Believing you know value without data
- Mistaking velocity (output) and value (outcome)
