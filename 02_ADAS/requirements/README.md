# L0 Requirements : Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)

Students will be challenged to define Level 0 (client) requirements that their project must satisfy. 
Each L0 requirement should be written from the client’s perspective, include measurable acceptance criteria, and be testable and traceable to the architecture and test cases. These requirements will drive scope, prioritization, and evaluation throughout the project and hackathons.
