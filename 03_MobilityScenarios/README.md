## Introduction

Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication is becoming increasingly essential in modern automotive technology. As vehicles evolve to interact dynamically with their environment, other vehicles, pedestrians, and the cloud git scustomers are expecting richer and more seamless mobility experiences. Such advancements have unlocked innovative scenarios like robotaxis, smart traffic management, electric charging optimization, enhanced safety features, and many other scenarios that were unimaginable just a few years ago.

Vehicles are now generating extensive amounts of data, providing OEMs great insights into customer behaviors, preferences, and usage patterns. This data-rich environment allows manufacturers to continuously refine and tailor their offerings, ensuring that customer expectations are constantly met.

In this module, your group will engage in a hands-on project where you'll select and implement a mobility and connectivity scenario using actual automotive technologies and real-world data.

## Goals for this Module

### Goal 1 – Define and Implement a Mobility and Connectivity Scenario

You will select a mobility scenario from the list below or propose your own. Your chosen scenario must provide a clear value by leveraging the interaction between the vehicle and external systems, whether that be a database, another road user, infrastructure, or other relevant entities.

Possible scenarios include:

* Robotaxi
* Smart Traffic Lights
* Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communication
* Electric Charge Stations Queue Management
* Road Surface Communication
* Smart Insurance
* Smart Intersection Alerts
* Shared Mobility Integration
* Emergency Vehicle Priority
* Crowdsourced Road Hazard Reporting
* Car-to-Bike Gamification

### Goal 2 – Document Architecture and Technology Choices

You will clearly document your project's architecture and the rationale behind your technology stack selection.

### Goal 3 – Establish Requirements and Traceability

You will define clear requirements for your solution and establish traceability from these requirements through your architecture and into implementation. This traceability will be managed using the Trustable Software Framework (TSF) integrated with GitHub, ensuring accountability and quality control.

### Goal 4 – Ensure Proper Test Coverage

You will implement comprehensive test coverage, demonstrating that your project meets its defined requirements and is resilient under various scenarios.

## Technologies Needed

To successfully implement these scenarios, you will likely engage with some of the following technologies:

* Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) protocols (DSRC, C-V2X)
* Real-time Operating Systems (RTOS)
* Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
* Database Systems (SQL, NoSQL)
* Edge Computing Platforms
* Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates
* CAN bus communication
* Ethernet and automotive-grade networks
* Microcontrollers and processors optimized for automotive use
* Cybersecurity frameworks and standards (ISO 21434)
* Automotive User Interface frameworks (Qt, Android Automotive OS)
* Wireless communication technologies (5G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
* Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
* RESTful APIs and data exchange protocols

## What is Expected by the End of this Module

By the end of this module, you will:

* Have chosen and implemented a meaningful V2X scenario in a practical environment.
* Have documented your project's architecture and technology choices clearly and thoroughly.
* Established and managed detailed requirements with traceability using TSF in GitHub.
* Provided extensive test coverage demonstrating reliability and quality of your solution.
